LPC2148 & Arduino Web-Based Simulator ðŸš€

Live Demo: [Click here to access the simulator](https://lpc2148-simulation.onrender.com)

Project Overview

This web-based simulator allows users to write, run, and visualize microcontroller code for LPC2148 (ARM) and Arduino. Users can control LEDs, select default/example codes, add custom code via a modal, and see real-time LED simulation. The simulator validates code and animates LED sequences interactively, providing an engaging learning environment for microcontroller programming.

How It Works

Users can select default or example codes or write custom code.

Clicking Run executes the code and shows a real-time simulation of LEDs.

Users can stop the simulation or modify the code to experiment with different logic.

LED sequences and outputs update interactively based on the code.

Features

Interactive LED simulation for LPC2148 and Arduino

Preloaded example codes for quick testing

Custom code input via a modal or code editor

Run/Stop buttons for real-time execution

Code validation before running to prevent errors

Fully web-based; works on desktop and mobile

Technology Stack

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, EJS
Backend: Node.js, Express.js (for server integration, example code loading, and code saving)
Simulation Engine: JavaScript-based LED animation

Benefits

Provides a hands-on learning environment for microcontroller programming

Eliminates the need for physical hardware to test code

Helps students and hobbyists experiment safely and visualize code behavior

Supports both LPC2148 (ARM) and Arduino programming logic

How to Use
Prerequisites

Node.js (v18 or above recommended)

Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)

Terminal or code editor (like VS Code)

Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/Dheeraj026-creator/Lpc2148-Simulation.git
cd LPC2148-Arduino-Simulator

Install Dependencies
npm install

Run the Application Locally
node app.js


By default, the app runs on http://localhost:5000

Open in Browser

Navigate to http://localhost:5000

Choose LPC2148 or Arduino, load example code, or add custom code

Example Codes

LED Blink: Basic blinking LED pattern

LED Sequence: Turns LEDs on and off in a sequence

Custom Patterns: Users can define their own LED patterns using code

Future Enhancements

Save user code online and load previously written programs

Extend support for more microcontrollers and peripherals

Add real-time debugging output with console logs

Mobile-optimized LED simulation and improved layout

Demo / Deployment

The simulator can be deployed on Render, Heroku, or any Node.js-compatible hosting.

Push the repository to the server.

Set environment variables if needed.

Run the application:

node app.js


Ensure EJS templates and public assets (CSS/JS) are served correctly using Express static middleware.
